                              Here’s a detailed step-by-step explanation of how online reservation portals function:
                              <br></br>
                              <br></br>
                              In order to use such a platform for your business, you need to register on a website as a proprietor and post your offers. Prepare to work with documents and set up payment gateways. You will need to provide some business credentials, as well as the content related to your place (photos, descriptions, address and other data). Once you’ve successfully registered, people will be able to reserve your rooms.
                              However, for the information to be updated in a timely manner, you also have to connect to channel management software: this solution synchronizes data across all booking websites including your own one. That eliminates the threat of double booking.
                              <br></br>
                              <br></br>
                              As a rule, once a customer reserves a room on a booking website, the data is refreshed instantly – this room and dates are no longer available. The reservation request is confirmed automatically if a customer pays according to the rules, and the hotelier gets notified about that, too.
                              A user gets the confirmation of booking on his email (as a rule, the PDF files are generated).
                              <br></br>
                              <br></br>
                              As for the payment, it is usually executed on the booking website. There’s no need to use third-party services.

                              Advantages & Benefits
                              <br></br>

                              <strong>2.</strong>  Easy Management of Reservations
                              Web-based reservation takes off the load from your employees making them way more productive. They won’t need to stay near the phone all day long. Furthermore, you will be able to organize appointments nonstop.

                              <strong>3.</strong>  Get a Deeper Insight In Business

                              <strong>4.</strong>  Enjoy Higher Profits & More Sales
                              Another significant advantage of an online reservation portal is simple creation, distribution, promotion and selling of your properties and extras in the Net.

                              <strong>5.</strong>  Automatic Renewal Of Availability Status
                              Sometimes, visitors who book rooms online don’t show up during the check-in time. In the situations when somebody doesn’t appear, a reservation website will make such property available for ordering again. Automatic notifications are an incredible way to remind customers of appointment and increase the chances of people will show up.
